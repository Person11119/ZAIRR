    <h1>Zair's Biography</h1>
    <p>Oh hi there, my name is Zair Fareed and I'm 12 years old. I live in Banigala, Islamabad, Pakistan. My hobbies are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Football</li>
        <li>Eating</li>
        <li>Playing video games</li>
        <li>Sketching</li>
        <li>Some other stuff</li>
    </ul>
    <p>I love sketching and playing football with my friends. I better mention them or they will be mad I didn’t let them have their share of being on a website. They are: Haysam, Rayan, Arham, and of course Shaki. I want to be an engineer when I grow up, and I want to live in the US. Why? Because they have Takis, Cheetos, and LOTS of chocolates, and it's clean. I have one brother (Shahab) and one sister (Shafaat). My favorite foods are: Pizza, Japanese food (e.g., sushi), and chocolate éclairs. My favorite subjects in school are: History, Computer Science, and Math. Now I guess you know stuff about me. Soo Bye!...Are you still here?</p>
